My goal for this project was to learn how to make a proper landing page using my current knowledge and flexbox. The image in the examples folder is what the landing page should somewhat look like. I myself played around with some properties and gave the project a little bit of my own style also. So the colors used and such are different from the example image.

I'm happy with the results and I was able to make everything the way I wanted to make it. The only thing I feel is that the code could be a bit more efficient/shorter/straight-to-the-point. But that's something I'll learn along the way as I get more experience.
